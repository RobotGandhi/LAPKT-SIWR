Notes von visitall_0.txt

sketch has width 0 only in problems where all locations must be visited.
In other cases, the sketch has width 1 because distance feature captures 
distance to unvisited goal cells and the other feature count ALL the visited cells.
To fix this, we must only count the number of visited goal cells instead.
